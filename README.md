# CIS122-Lab-GrahamWilkins
Repository for everything in John Burke's CIS-122 Lab Class.

What I learned while working on this:
* I learned the basics C# programming, including logic, OOP, and how multiple classes can interact with eachother to create a bigger product.
* I learned how to use ASP.NET to display data on a website.
* I learned how to open and read information from a CSV file.
